# ISLP-solutions

This repository contains my on-going solutions to exercises from - **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** _with Python_, authored by [Gareth James](https://www.garethmjames.com/), [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/), [Trevor Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/), [Rob Tibshirani](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/), and [Jonathan Taylor](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/). <br>
This is a great book introducing statistical learning techniques with practical exercises and labs. You can find the PDF and other resources for free on the [official page](https://www.statlearning.com/).

### About this Repo
The repository is organized by chapter, with each chapter containing:
- Jupyter notebook for each set of exercise
- HTML exports of the notebooks (recommended for easier reading)

### Note
Please attempt the problems before looking at the solutions and use this only as a reference for your own solutions <br>
These are my personal answers, and **there may be mistakes**. <br><br>
Chapters 2 and 3 have a different structure than the rest. The organization will be improved in later chapters.
